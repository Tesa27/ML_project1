# ML_project


Our submission for the project 1.

The team is comprised of :
  - Jana Vuckovic
  - Stefan Eric
  - Johann Pl√ºss


The files includes the following :
  - implementations.py with the 6 required functions
  - run.py which contains the simple regression that got the best submission result. By uncommenting the call to main_model(), run.py computes a result based on our more complex ML model, which produced results slighlty lower than the aforementioned.
